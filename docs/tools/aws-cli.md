# AWS Command Line Interface - CLI

The [AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.

> See [practicalli/dotfiles for an example of an .aws/config file](https://github.com/practicalli/dotfiles/blob/main/aws/config) with profiles and Okta single sign-on

## Creating profiles for environments

Software engineering teams should have the ability to deploy on at least a test and staging environment (with production typically kept for operations focused roles or teams).

The AWS CLI can have multiple profiles with configuration specific to the environment.

```
## Default settings used with all profiles
# [default]
# region = eu-west-2


# [profile test]
# role_arn = arn:aws:iam::************:role/Developer
# mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::************:mfa/my.email@company-domain.com
# source_profile = default

# [profile staging]
# role_arn = arn:aws:iam::************:role/Developer
# mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::************:mfa/my.email@company-domain.com
# source_profile = default
```


## Okta Single Sign-on

Okta is a widely used Single Sign-on solution for managing access to business apps as well as Amazon Web Services (AWS) console and APIs.

Define a profile (optional, but recommended) that contains the URL for the Okta single sign-on service and its authorisation endpoint.

Define an `sso_region` that matches the AWS region in which the AWS profile should operate within.

Add and `sso_account_id` and `sso_role_name` to define identity within AWS.

```
[profile domain-staging]
sso_start_url = https://<sso-domain>.com/start
sso_region = eu-west-2
sso_account_id = <arn:aws:iam value>
sso_role_name = PowerUserAccess
region = eu-west-2
```
