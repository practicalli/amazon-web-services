# Practicalli Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Amazon web services are an ever increasing and evolving set of Cloud services to support a wide range of deployment requirements for custom software services.  AWS also includes a growing number of off-the-shelf services, especially in the realm of data science.

> Practicalli content focuses on tools and services the team has used for commercial projects, so will not cover all services offered

??? HINT "Localstack provides AWS services locally"
    Use [Localstack](https://docs.localstack.cloud/getting-started) instead of creating an account if only using the services locally.

    Localstack [implements many of the AWS services](https://docs.localstack.cloud/references/coverage/), although some services are only commercially available


## Getting Started

=== "Personal projects"
    [:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Setup Root and IAM accounts](accounts/)

    - Find a valid credit / debit card needed to create the account (temporary $1 charge)
    - Create a root account for to administer the overall AWS account
    - Create an IAM account with Management Console login for working with AWS services
    - Create an IAM account for services to access AWS (non-login)

=== "Commercial projects"
    Ask the AWS administrator within the organisation to create an IAM user fs

    Specify the access required or identify a colleague that has the same AWS access required

[:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Install AWS CLI version 2](/amazon-web-services/tools/aws-cli/)

[:fontawesome-solid-book-open: Configure access via the IAM account](/amazon-web-services/tools/aws-cli/#create-local-configuration)
