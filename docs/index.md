# Practicalli Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Amazon web services are an ever increasing and evolving set of Cloud services to support a wide range of deployment requirements for custom software services.  AWS also includes a growing number of off-the-shelf services, especially in the realm of data science.

> Practicalli content focuses on tools and services the team has used for commercial projects, so will not cover all services offered
