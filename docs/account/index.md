# AWS Accounts

An account is required to use AWS services

- Root account - general adminstration of the overall AWS account, including management of IAM accounts
- IAM account - daily use account, either for humans or code/scripts/command line access

Engineers and systems should use an IAM account

Only persons responsible for administrating the whole AWS account should login via the root account and only when carrying out administrative duties.


## Root Account Requirements

A credit card is required to create a Root account and a temporary change of $1 is made, which is returned within 3-5 days.
